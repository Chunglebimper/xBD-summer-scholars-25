The images from the dataset are 32-bit which means they can display transparency
The PIL library cannot handle these images but it can handle downscaled version
Alpha means how transparent a pixel is where 0 is (fully) transparent and 255 is opaque
The increased resolution size of 1262 from 1024 causes averaging of pixels in the stretched area (ie. not raw data)
Patch size and stride will determine bleeding of images in the model


UPDATE:
IMAGES ARE NOW DISPLAYED AS THEY SHOULD BE IN FULL 1024 x 1024 WHILE ALSO BEING SEPERATED INTO BANDS

TODO
Research one-shot few shot learning techniques
Augmentation?

When code is done, allow it to be ran through terminal
