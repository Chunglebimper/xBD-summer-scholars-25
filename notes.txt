The images from the dataset are 32-bit which means they can display transparency
The PIL library cannot handle these images but it can handle downscaled version
Alpha means how transparent a pixel is where 0 is (fully) transparent and 255 is opaque
The increased resolution size of 1262 from 1024 causes averaging of pixels in the stretched area (ie. not raw data)

UPDATE:
IMAGES ARE NOW DISPLAYED AS THEY SHOULD BE IN FULL 1024 x 1024 WHILE ALSO BEING SEPERATED INTO BANDS

TODO
Manage alpha values (may not be necessary)
